## Optical-Character-Recognition-for-Offline-Handwritten-Mathematical-Expressions-Using-FPGA
This repository contains Feedforward Neural Network design for FPGA implementation. The design was written in verilog code. This project is divided into two main subsystems: forward subsystem and backpropagation subsystem. The first one is responsible for inference process in Neural Network and the later one is for training process. 

## Hardware Design Approaches
We uses two approaches in designing this hardware:
1. **Paralel Computation**. This approach boosts computation speed at expense of area of the chip.
2. **Hardware Sharing**. This approach reduces the area required in a chip at expense of speed.

By implementing those two opposite approaces in the right condition, we can maximize both speed and area.
